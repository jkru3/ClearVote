      <p>From that list, YOU decide what is important</p>
      <p>Your local election candidates have done the same, and we'll show you who most lines up with your values at the end.</p>
      
      <p>Our goals are: <br /> 
      1. to foster unity across all political spectrums <br /> 
      2. to provide transparency covering the values our representatives support</p>
